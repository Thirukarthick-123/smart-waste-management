# 🗑️ Smart Waste Management System with IoT Simulation and AI Optimization

## 📘 Project Overview

The Smart Waste Management System with IoT Simulation and AI Optimization is an academic project designed to improve the efficiency of waste collection and monitoring using Internet of Things (IoT) and **Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies.

Conventional waste management practices are labor-intensive, inefficient, and costly. This project proposes a smart and sustainable solution by integrating IoT-enabled sensors to track waste bin fill levels and employing AI-based algorithms to plan optimal collection routes. The system ensures efficient resource utilization, reduced fuel consumption, and a cleaner environment.
